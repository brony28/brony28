### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, about me - 

Seasonal coder? More like an impulsive one. 
Mostly use this as my public/private dump of codes and stuff. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Data Analyst, primarily using PowerBI (BI Tool). Also a certified MS Data Analyst by clearing the PL300 certification. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m curious about almost all domains of tech except Blockchain(still don't understand it). 
- ðŸ¤” TBD

Will update more here, as and when I progress in the tech journey.
